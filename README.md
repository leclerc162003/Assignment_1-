PROJECT OVERVIEW
My project name is SuperM page. 
This is a page about a k-pop band SuperM. In this page, you can watch their latest viedo, book the latest tickets to their show and even book for gigs as it shows you their available timing. It even shows you the different merchandises they have that you can buy to support them. lastly, if you have any inquires, you can submit it in the contact us page. 
This is to allow fans to know more about our group through our videos as well as selling our tours and merchandises to them.

DESIGN PROCESS
As this website is for the fans, it needs to be user-friendly and simple to navigate with an well-organized structure of the page. 
As a customer, I want to use the tours & tickets feature and buy the tickets to the latest show as simple as that. 
As a customer, I want to read the about us page, so that I can learn more about the band.
As a customer, I want to submit an inquiry form, so that I can ask about it cost to book them.
