        <section class="us">
            <p>We are SuperM, one of Asia's finest Korean bands. We are made up of 7 members from different popular K-pop bands (from the likes of 
                Exo, Shinee and NCT). We have songs like Jopping and 100. Which topped the 200 Billboard Charts in America in both 2019 and 2020. We
                also had our first US Tour in 2019 with sell-out venues all around America. Our current 2020 tour is on a halt due to the current Covid-19
                Pandemic.
